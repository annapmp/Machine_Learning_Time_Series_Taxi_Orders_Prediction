# Machine_Learning_Time_Series_Taxi_Orders_Prediction

## Project description
Sweet Lift Taxi company has collected historical data on taxi orders at
airports. To attract more drivers during peak hours, we need to predict the
amount of taxi orders for the next hour. We will build a model for such a prediction.
The RMSE metric on the test set should not be more than 48.
